# write_turns

This is my attempt to make a writing app that works the way I need to work around my ADHD.

The basic idea is that this app allows writing and only writing (not editing, save that for later in another application suited for editing) by only allowing the user to edit the current paragraph being written.

When the user presses "Enter" to start a new paragraph, the paragraph they have just written is appended to the text file they are working on. The only part of the text file that is displayed to the user is the last (previous) paragraph written. I felt this was useful to allow for context, especially if coming back to writing the text after some time.

The "turns" in the title are a reference to timed sessions for writing, which can be set up to work like the Pomodoro technique. Each completed "turn" (or timed writing session) is logged, providing data for visual displays of writing data that can be both helpful and that I find encouraging, as do many others with similar neurodiversity issues to mine.

In addition, this data can be used to create little audiovisual "rewards" for completing turns, reaching a set number of turns (or other goals), by writing on a set number of days in a row, or similar. These little "treats" (when done correctly) can have a powerful motivating effect on me.

I am making no claim to speak for the entire "neurodiversity community". My hope is that by creating something that is useful for me, others may find it helpful as well.

My goals (although they may change) for this project are:

- Learn Flutter development
- Make a useful tool for my own writing
- Learn cross-platform development
- Learn more about what does and does not help me write
- Learn about accessibility issues
- Release an application that is useful for other people
